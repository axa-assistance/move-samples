# Using AXA Assistance APIs - samples

This repository is organized as follows:

-   OAuth2-ROPC: you want to access AXA Assistance APIs using the OAuth2
Resource Owner Password Credentials grant? Then this sample is the one for you!
Beware that it means your end-user will have to enter his username/password directly in your application.

This grant type is suitable in cases where the resource owner has a trust
relationship with the client, such as the device operating system or a highly
privileged application.
